## Finternet Core

The Finternet Core is the foundation of the Finternet ecosystem. It provides the essential primitives, runtime environment, and smart contract interfaces that enable different components and providers to interact seamlessly.

### Primitives

Primitives in the Finternet Core are the basic building blocks used throughout the ecosystem. These may include data types, cryptographic functions, and consensus algorithms that define how transactions are validated and processed. Primitives ensure a consistent and secure foundation for building more complex functionalities.

### Runtime

The runtime component of the Finternet Core provides the execution environment for smart contracts and other on-chain logic. It handles the orchestration of transactions, state management, and ensures that all operations comply with the rules defined by the protocol. This component is critical for maintaining the integrity and performance of the Finternet.

### Smartcontract Interface

Smart contract interfaces in the Finternet Core define the standards and protocols for creating and interacting with smart contracts on the network. These interfaces facilitate the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and ensure compatibility across different providers.

#### User Manager

The User Manager interface defines the protocols for managing user identities, permissions, and authentication on the Finternet. It ensures that user data is handled securely and efficiently, providing a robust framework for user-centric applications.

#### Token Manager

The Token Manager interface outlines the functionality for issuing, transferring, and managing tokens within the Finternet ecosystem. It standardizes token operations, enabling seamless integration and interaction between different dApps and providers.

## Solana UL Provider

The Solana UL Provider is a specific implementation of a Unified Ledger Provider for the Finternet, utilizing the Solana blockchain for its high throughput and low-latency characteristics. This provider includes APIs and smart contract interfaces that leverage Solana's capabilities.

### UL API/API Handlers

The UL API and its handlers define the communication protocols between the Solana Unified Ledger Provider and the applications on the Finternet. These APIs manage requests for data, transaction submissions, and other interactions necessary for dApps to function properly within the ecosystem. They ensure that developers can build applications that are performant and responsive.

### UL Smartcontract Interface

The UL Smartcontract Interface for the Solana provider details the specific smart contract standards and methods used within the Solana environment. This interface ensures that smart contracts are compatible with the Solana blockchain's architecture and performance characteristics, facilitating smooth integration with other Finternet components.
