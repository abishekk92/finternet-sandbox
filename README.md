## Finternet Core

The Finternet Core serves as the cornerstone for the whole Finternet ecosystem. It includes the necessary primitives, runtime environment, and smart contract interfaces that allow various components and providers to communicate seamlessly.

### Primitives

Primitives in the Finternet Core are fundamental building elements utilized across the ecosystem. These might contain data types, cryptographic functions, and consensus methods that govern how transactions are validated and handled. Primitives provide a consistent and safe framework for developing more complicated functionality.

### Runtime

The runtime component of the Finternet Core serves as the execution environment for smart contracts and other on-chain functionality. It manages state, orchestrates transactions, and guarantees that all activities follow the protocol's rules. This component is important to the integrity and operation of the Finternet.

### Smartcontract Interface

Smart contract interfaces in the Finternet Core specify the standards and protocols for establishing and interacting with smart contracts on the network. These APIs make it easier to create decentralized apps (dApps) while also ensuring interoperability among providers.

#### User Manager

The User Manager interface specifies the protocols for managing user identities, rights, and authentication via the Finternet. It guarantees that user data is handled safely and effectively, hence providing a strong foundation for user-centric applications.

#### Token Manager

The Token Manager interface describes the functionality for issuing, transferring, and maintaining tokens in the Finternet ecosystem. It standardizes token operations, allowing for smooth integration and interaction across various dApps and suppliers.

## Solana UL Provider

The Solana UL Provider is a example version of the Finternet's Unified Ledger Provider that makes use of the Solana blockchain's high throughput and low latency. This provider includes APIs and smart contract interfaces that leverage Solana's capabilities.

### UL API/API Handlers

The UL API and its handlers establish the communication protocols that the Solana Unified Ledger Provider uses to interact with Finternet applications. These APIs handle data requests, transaction submissions, and other interactions that dApps require to function successfully in the ecosystem. They guarantee that developers may create apps that are both performant and responsive.

### UL Smartcontract Interface

The UL Smartcontract Interface for the Solana provider specifies the smart contract standards and procedures utilized in the Solana ecosystem. This interface guarantees that smart contracts comply with the Solana blockchain's design and performance characteristics, allowing for seamless connection with other Finternet components.
